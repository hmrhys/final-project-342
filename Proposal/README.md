# Gameshelf
## Problem
Living in such a technologically advanced and centric age, there are so many different possibilites and heights that video games can now be taken to. Going from simple block games like Tetris from the early stages of video game creation, to open-world sandboxes, multi-layered role-playing, story-based and simulators, and hyper-realistic graphics (as well as so much more), the possibilities of games are endless. In addition to such a wide range of functional features in video games, there has been a rise in small and independently produced games. That is, it is becoming easier for indie developers to create and produce games without the need of a publisher. Ultimately this has led to more diversity and innovation in games, and also, of course, has contributed to a significantly larger pool of games to choose from when looking for something to play. So with that, the problem that our PWA attempts to solve is narrowing that scope for users and easily finding the perfect games to play.

**Gameshelf** offers a way for gamers to publically rate, view, and list different video games, so that others can see and better gauge if it's a game that they are really interested in exploring further. Essentially to the user, it proposes a Goodreads or Letterboxd for video games. While there are already several public communities out there specifically for video games, **Gameshelf** would uniquely offer an easy to access and navigate platform to not only connect with those that enjoy the same video games, but also to quickly discover and explore other video games that they might like but may have not heard of before. **Gameshelf** is open to anyone who enjoys video games, regardless of gaming experience or intensity of hobby.
## Features
### General Capabilities
**Gameshelf** will allow users to log in or create an account, search for games or users, view game ratings and add their own rating, and view other user's profiles. For these features to work we will need to store user information and video game titles and ratings in a database. We plan to start the database with a few games that we have already played, if the game is not in the database the user will have the option to add a new game.
### Required Data
**Gameshelf** is primarily a community-driven application. As such, it relies heavily on the interactions of other users with the system in order to create the most optimal experience for the user. User data such as login information and the video games they've rated will be data that is needed and this information will be stored in a database to keep track of multiples users and the many video games that will be added and rated. It will also use an API to access a video game database to provide information about games and facilitate searching.
